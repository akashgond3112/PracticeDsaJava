Minimum Spanning Tree
Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 47.82%Submissions: 127K+Points: 4
Given a weighted, undirected, and connected graph with V vertices and E edges, your task is to find the sum of the weights of the edges in the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of the graph. The graph is represented by an adjacency list, where each element adj[i] is a vector containing pairs of integers. Each pair represents an edge, with the first integer denoting the endpoint of the edge and the second integer denoting the weight of the edge.

Example 1:

Input:
3 3
0 1 5
1 2 3
0 2 1

Output:
4
Explanation:

The Spanning Tree resulting in a weight
of 4 is shown above.
Example 2:

Input:
2 1
0 1 5

Output:
5
Explanation:
Only one Spanning Tree is possible
which has a weight of 5.


Your task:
Since this is a functional problem you don't have to worry about input, you just have to complete the function spanningTree() which takes a number of vertices V and an adjacency list adj as input parameters and returns an integer denoting the sum of weights of the edges of the Minimum Spanning Tree. Here adj[i] contains vectors of size 2, where the first integer in that vector denotes the end of the edge and the second integer denotes the edge weight.

Expected Time Complexity: O(ElogV).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(V2).


Constraints:
2 ≤ V ≤ 1000
V-1 ≤ E ≤ (V*(V-1))/2
1 ≤ w ≤ 1000
The graph is connected and doesn't contain self-loops & multiple edges.

Time Complexity: O(E*logE) + O(E*logE)~ O(E*logE), where E = no. of given edges.
The maximum size of the priority queue can be E so after at most E iterations the priority queue will be empty and the loop will end. Inside the loop, there is a pop operation that will take logE time. This will result in the first O(E*logE) time complexity. Now, inside that loop, for every node, we need to traverse all its adjacent nodes where the number of nodes can be at most E. If we find any node unvisited, we will perform a push operation and for that, we need a logE time complexity. So this will result in the second O(E*logE).

Space Complexity: O(E) + O(V), where E = no. of edges and V = no. of vertices. O(E) occurs due to the size of the priority queue and O(V) due to the visited array. If we wish to get the mst, we need an extra O(V-1) space to store the edges of the most.
