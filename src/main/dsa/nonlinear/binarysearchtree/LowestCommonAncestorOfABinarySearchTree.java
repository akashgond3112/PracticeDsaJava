/**
 * 235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree Medium Topics Companies
 * Given a binary search tree (BST), find
 * the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.
 * <p>
 * According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor
 * is defined between two nodes p and q as
 * the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a
 * node to be a descendant of itself).”
 * <p>
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 *
 * Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8 Output: 6
 * Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 *
 * Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4 Output: 2
 * Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since
 * a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition. Example
 * 3:
 * <p>
 * Input: root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1 Output: 2
 * <p>
 *
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 105]. -109 <= Node.val <=
 * 109 All Node.val are unique. p != q p
 * and q will exist in the BST.
