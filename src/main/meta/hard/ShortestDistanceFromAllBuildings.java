 *
 * 317. Shortest Distance from All Buildings
 * Description
 * You are given an m x n grid grid of values 0, 1, or 2, where:
 *
 * each 0 marks an empty land that you can pass by freely,
 * each 1 marks a building that you cannot pass through, and
 * each 2 marks an obstacle that you cannot pass through.
 * You want to build a house on an empty land that reaches all buildings in the shortest total travel distance. You can only move up, down, left, and right.
 *
 * Return the shortest travel distance for such a house. If it is not possible to build such a house according to the above rules, return -1.
 *
 * The total travel distance is the sum of the distances between the houses of the friends and the meeting point.
 *
 * The distance is calculated using Manhattan Distance, where distance(p1, p2) = |p2.x - p1.x| + |p2.y - p1.y|.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: [[1,0,2,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0]]
 *
 * 1 - 0 - 2 - 0 - 1
 * |   |   |   |   |
 * 0 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 0
 * |   |   |   |   |
 * 0 - 0 - 1 - 0 - 0
 *
 * Output: 7
 *
 * Explanation: Given three buildings at (0,0), (0,4), (2,2), and an obstacle at (0,2),
 *              the point (1,2) is an ideal empty land to build a house, as the total
 *              travel distance of 3+3+1=7 is minimal. So return 7.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: grid = [[1,0]]
 * Output: 1
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: grid = [[1]]
 * Output: -1
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * m == grid.length
 * n == grid[i].length
 * 1 <= m, n <= 50
 * grid[i][j] is either 0, 1, or 2.
 * There will be at least one building in the grid.

	/**
	 * Solution for finding the shortest distance from an empty land to all buildings.
	 *
	 * Problem: Given a 2D grid where:
	 * - 1 represents a building
	 * - 0 represents empty land
	 * - 2 represents obstacle Find the empty land with the shortest total distance to all buildings.
	 *
	 * Approach:
	 * - Run BFS from each building to find distances to all empty lands
	 * - Keep track of how many buildings each empty land can reach
	 * - Find the empty land that can reach all buildings with minimum total distance
	 *
	 * Time Complexity: O(k * m * n) where:
	 * - m, n are the dimensions of the grid
	 * - k is the number of buildings
	 *
	 * Space Complexity: O(m * n)
