/*
 * * 973. K Closest Points to Origin Medium Topics Companies Given an array of points where
 * points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest
 * points to the origin (0, 0).
 * 
 * The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 +
 * (y1 - y2)2).
 * 
 * You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the
 * order that it is in).
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1 Output: [[-2,2]] Explanation: The distance between (1, 3)
 * and the origin is sqrt(10). The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8). Since sqrt(8)
 * < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin. We only want the closest k = 1 points from the
 * origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]]. Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2 Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]] Explanation: The answer
 * [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 1 <= k <= points.length <= 104 -104 <= xi, yi <= 104
