/**
 * 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock Easy Topics Companies You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price
 * of a given stock on the ith day.
 *
 * You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future
 * to sell that stock.
 *
 * Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4] Output: 5 Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit =
 * 6-1 = 5. Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell. Example
 * 2:
 *
 * Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1] Output: 0 Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= prices.length <= 105 0 <= prices[i] <= 104
