/**
 * 1047. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates In String Easy Topics Companies Hint You are given a string s consisting of
 * lowercase English letters. A duplicate removal consists of choosing two adjacent and equal letters and removing
 * them.
 * <p>
 * We repeatedly make duplicate removals on s until we no longer can.
 * <p>
 * Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made. It can be proven that the answer is
 * unique.
 * <p>
 *
 * Example 1: Input: s = "abbaca" Output: "ca" Explanation: For example, in "abbaca" we could remove "bb" since the
 * letters are adjacent and equal, and this is the only possible move.  The result of this move is that the string is
 * "aaca", of which only "aa" is possible, so the final string is "ca".
 *
 * Example 2: Input: s = "azxxzy" Output: "ay"
 *
 * Constraints: 1 <= s.length <= 105 s consists of lowercase English letters.

	/**
	 * #### **Time Complexity:**
	 * - We traverse the string **once** (`O(n)`) and for each character, we either **append** or **delete** from
	 * `StringBuilder`, which takes **O(1)** time per operation.
	 * - Thus, the overall **time complexity is O(n)**.
	 *
	 * #### **Space Complexity:**
	 * - The worst-case space complexity occurs when there are **no duplicates**, meaning we store the entire string in
	 * `StringBuilder`, which takes **O(n) space**.
	 * - In cases where duplicates exist, the space usage is **less than O(n)** but still **O(n) in the worst case**.
	 *
	 * ### **Final Complexity:**
	 * - **Time Complexity: O(n)**
	 * - **Space Complexity: O(n) (due to the StringBuilder stack usage)**
	 *
	 * This is the most optimal approach compared to recursion, which would use **O(n) extra space** for function calls.
